Hi. My name is Pete. I've been designing and building websites and applications for over 15 years. For the past 5 or 6 years I've been working primarily as a front-end developer. Earlier in my career I was working primarily as a designer with a focus on functional design. Either way, I've always enjoyed creating beautiful, usable, accessible and useful websites and applications. My broad range of experience means that I work well in cross-functional teams - especially in that sometimes difficult area where design, business requirements and production meet. I enjoy working on products - where I can see and be part of continual improvements to the user experience. I love creating things and I love to learn. I have recently moved to Dublin and when I'm not busy tapping away on a computer I'm usually hiding away somewhere trying to play my fiddle.
