intro: In 2008, my wife and I went on an adventure. We left from Dublin and thought we'd see how far we could get without flying. After about eight months we got as far as Bali. We kept a blog as we were travelling - full of writing, photos and audio clips. I recently upgraded the blog site with higher resolution photographs and a new custom built Wordpress theme.
