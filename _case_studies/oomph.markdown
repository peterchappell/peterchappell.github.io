intro: >
  [Oomph](https://oomphhq.com/) have created a publishing system that makes it easy to create iPad apps with engaging content. I (working as Experience Bureau) helped by providing user experience consultancy services for some aspects of the system.
quote: Just wanted to thank you for the work you did on the report. The guys ... [have] mandated it's reading across all the devs! :) They said they really liked the way there are principles they can apply elsewhere. So another big thanks!
