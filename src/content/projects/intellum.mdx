Intellum provide learning management solutions to a wide range of clients including Google, Facebook, 
Amazon, and Snapchat. I worked as a front-end engineer on a wide range of projects including Exceed
(their learning management system), Catcat (a public catalogue of learning material) and Tribe (a social
media application with chat facilities).

### Some of the projects I worked on for Intellum

#### Learning planner

"My plan" is a feature in Exceed LMS that enables the building out of a personalised learning plan. Required
and elected learning material can be scheduled and managed collaboratively by users and their managers.

#### Content editing

I helped implement a simplified WYSIWYG content editor for building out learning the content. The editing UI is
based on the document editing approach popularised by medium.

#### Tribe Chat

Tribe Chat is a fully feature complete chat facility. It works as a standalone product but it can also be 
integrated into Intellum's learning environment. I led the build of the front-end for the chat application
using React and Redux.

#### General feature development and support

Exceed is built as a traditional server-side rendered website using Ruby on Rails. It has a set of features
that is continually growing and as such it required continual front-end development and support.
