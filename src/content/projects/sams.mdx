SAMS is a web application used for remotely monitoring and controlling large engineering type devices. 
Much of the application runs as a single page web app that continually and efficiently refreshes data 
without requiring full page reloads. The application works across different browsers on a variety of 
devices, allowing it to be used both in the field and from an office. Working as Experience Bureau, I 
designed the interface and built most of the front-end of the SAMS application.

When we started working on SAMS we had no idea that we’d be able to create something so app-like and user-friendly. It’s clear, fast and it works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
